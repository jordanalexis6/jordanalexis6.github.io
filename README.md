I am using this Github repository for my portfolio page.
I have an index.html that will be my home page, portfolio.html with all of my soon to be work, and a contact.html for all my contact info.
I also have a style.css page for these pages. 
I have linked reset.css and bootstrap to the head of all my html pages.
I also added the js link to make the bootstrap work on my page.
